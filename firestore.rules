/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for WOD management.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user has full control over their own WODs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All WOD data is nested under /users/{userId}/wods/{wodId}, ensuring data isolation between users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own WODs.
 * - WOD listing is restricted to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The rules rely on the path-based userId to ensure authorization. The data within the WOD documents does not need to be read to determine ownership.
